# raskovnik & planitor
Monitor plants &amp; keep them alive autonomously

## raskovnik
According to Slavic folklore, the raskovnik has the magical property to unlock or uncover anything that is locked or closed. [1] To us, raskovnik is unlocking the magic of growing food anywhere, even in space!

In our project, raskovnik is the mechanical and physical machinery supporting automated plant growth. It is the bones and muscles of the automation!

## planitor
In our project, planitory is the software code used to control raskovnik. Think of planitor as the brain of automation! Together with raskovnik, planitor creates a fully automated plant-growth system!
